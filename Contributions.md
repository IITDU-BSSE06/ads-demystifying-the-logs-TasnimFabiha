For assignment 3 and 4, I firts took help from this link,
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1518522/python-most-common-element-in-a-list
this code snippet gave the exact output desired for these assignment. But I failed to understand the inner mechanism of the function. 

Then I discussed with my classmates, and got the idea of taking help from the code that was done in our class room.
Then I was able to match my logic with that reducer code. I completed these 2 assignments by modifyng that reducer code which was provided in our classroom.


Assignment 5 were also done by modifying the previous reducer code

for checking each line's validity sent from mapper, I took help from following link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9573244/most-elegant-way-to-check-if-the-string-is-empty-in-python
